# GMLinear (Workbench)
Matrix and vector library for GameMaker Studio 1.x (with test suite)

## Introduction
GMLinear is an implementation of matrix and vector operations in pure GML. You can use it to simplify many common calculations in 2D and 3D geometry and implement algorithms/formulas involving linear algebra. Hard-coded optimized functions are available for 2D, 3D and 4D vectors and 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 matrices.

## Requirements
- GameMaker Studio 1.4 or above

## Contributing to GMLinear
This is the official workbench for the library. Please make and test your changes here first.
+ Clone both `gmlinear` and `gmlinear-workbench`.
+ Open the workbench in GameMaker Studio and make your additions/changes to the `GMLinear` script group. Also add corresponding tests to the `GMLinear_test` script group.
+ Export the `GMLinear` script group to `gmlinear-workbench`, overwriting its copy of `gmlinear.gml`.
+ Open a pull request on both `gmlinear` and `gmlinear-workbench`.
