# GMLinear Legacy v2.0.0

Matrix and vector library for GameMaker Studio 1.x

## Introduction

GMLinear is an implementation of matrix and vector operations in pure GML. You can use it to simplify many common calculations in 2D and 3D geometry and implement algorithms/formulas involving linear algebra. Hard-coded optimized functions are available for 2D, 3D and 4D vectors and 2x2, 3x3 and 4x4 matrices.

## Requirements

- GameMaker Studio 1.4.9999 only

If you use GameMaker Studio 2.x, please see [GMLinear 2](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmlinear2).

## Installation

- Download the latest GMEZ file from [the Releases page](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmlinear-legacy/releases).
- In the IDE, right-click on Extensions > Import Extension and select your downloaded GMEZ file.

## Contributing to GMLinear

- Clone this repository.
- Open the project in GameMaker Studio and make your additions/changes to the `GMLinear` extension. Also add corresponding tests to the `GMLinear_test` script group.
- Use F5 to run the test suite. A successful run should exit on its own without showing any errors (native platforms) or show a green background (HTML5-based platforms).
- Open a pull request [here](https://github.com/dicksonlaw583/gmlinear-legacy/issues).
